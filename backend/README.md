# Backend placeholder

This folder is reserved for backend code (API server, functions, etc.).

Suggested next steps:
- Add an `api/` folder and implement endpoints (Express, Fastify, or serverless functions).
- If you want to serve the frontend from the backend, configure a build step to copy `frontend/dist` into a static directory.
